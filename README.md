# _Beep Boop_

#### _Array and looping practice, homework as assigned by Epicodus, 1/25/19_

#### By _**Slater Smith**_

## Description

_A simple form that will return a numbered list from zero to any positive number input by the user, the catch being that all numbers with digits containing 1, 2, or 3 will appear within the returned list as one of three non-numerical values. Those values will appear within the list as the message "Beep!", "Boop", or "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."_

#### Program behavior specifications:
* _The program will return a range of numbers from 0 to the user's inputted number._
* _Within the range, the program returns "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that." instead of a number if a number contains the digit "3"._
* _The program returns "Boop" if a number contains the digit "2" and not a 3._
* _The program returns "Beep!" if a number contains the digit "1" and not a 2 or 3._
* _The program returns an error message if the user does not enter a positive number greater than or equal to 1._
